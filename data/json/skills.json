covers the manufacture of free-standing and built-in furniture and units, using wood at the sole or main material. It may include the design of furniture, but normally comprises the creation of furniture and units from designs prepared by others. Cabinetmaking differs from joinery through the quality of the wood and associated materials used, and the intricacy and aesthetic quality of the finished items. There is, however, some overlap between cabinetmaking and joinery.</p>\n\n<p>A cabinetmaker generally works on commercial and residential assignments of a high quality and value. They will therefore exhibit very high standards of skill and professionalism in order to justify clients&rsquo; expectations and willingness to pay. Most cabinetmakers work in small companies which have to be very sensitive to their reputation and market in order to sustain their businesses&rsquo; viability.</p>\n\n<p>The cabinetmaker will produce furniture and fittings in a workshop, at least until installing fitted items. However, in order to meet clients&rsquo; needs, including for the items to add to the aesthetic qualities of their environment they are placed in, they will know intimately where bespoke items are intended to be placed. For items produced speculatively rather than for known clients, the cabinetmaker will have a clear view of the types of location and setting that will show the items at their best.</p>\n\n<p>The cabinetmaker will produce, interpret and/or adapt drawings, set out and measure, cut, form joints, assemble, install if need be, and finish to a high standard. The quality of their work will show in:</p>\n\n<p>The selection of the wood and other materials;</p>\n\n<p>The placing of the wood to bring out its particular characteristics;</p>\n\n<p>Construction techniques which allow for the natural movement of timber to achieve longevity and quality in the furniture piece;</p>\n\n<p>The selection of additional materials including veneers and fittings;</p>\n\n<p>The near-perfect fit of each part following accurate measurement, cutting and assembly, and</p>\n\n<p>The final appearance of the item.</p>\n\n<p>Work organization and self-management, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, innovation and creativity, working precisely and accurately are the universal attributes of the cabinetmaker. They assume a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. From working safely through to exceptional planning and organizing, accuracy, concentration, and attention to detail to achieve an excellent finish every step in the process matters and mistakes are largely irreversible and very costly.</p>\n\n<p>Modern technology and mass production have enabled furniture and fittings, previously available only to the wealthy, to be more widely available. However, for those with disposable income and an eye for quality, the cabinetmaker is able to produce furniture and fittings that are a lasting pleasure both to use and to look at. In this discerning market the outstanding cabinetmaker will always be in demand.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":169,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Construction

Construction"},"description":{"lang_code":"en","text":"<p>Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a process for creating and managing information on a construction project across the project lifecycle. One of the key outputs of this process is the Building Information Model, the digital description of every aspect of the built asset. This model draws on information assembled collaboratively and updated at key stages of a project. Creating a digital Building Information Model enables those who interact with the building to optimize their actions, resulting in a greater whole life value for the asset.</p>\n\n<p>With the new BIM era, the design and construction industry is dealing with an explosion of software technologies made available under the umbrella of &ldquo;BIM&rdquo;. As a result, approaching the design, engineering and construction of buildings is changing exponentially from design storytelling to engineering calculation and delivery of a finished building. This means that existing professions face different demands, new workflows and new skills in performing the role of a Building Information Modeller.</p>\n\n<p>Collaboration is vital to the success of this role, BIM demands, more than ever, a high level of people-skills in the form of communication, collaboration and proactivity. BIM requires the recruitment of professionals with better people skills. To bring architects, architectural technologists, engineers and contractors together, to combine and enhance their collective output, calls for the complex interplay of technical skills, BIM and communication skills, all of which must be at a professional standard.</p>\n\n<p>Computer aided design is the use of computer systems as a tool to assist in the creation, modification, analysis, and optimization of a BIM model. CAD software is used to increase the productivity of the BIM modeller, improve the quality of design, improve communication through documentation, and create a database for project implementation. The CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for cloud sharing, cloud collaboration, Investigation, manufacturing or other Construction processes. The technical and architectural models and images must convey information such as Project location, building organizing elements, structured data, according to application-specific conventions. CAD is also used to produce computer animation, VR and AR experiences during the whole BIM cycle including advertising and technical manuals.</p>\n\n<p>CAD is an important industrial tool for BIM implementation and is the way construction projects come true. Its process and outputs are essential to successful solutions for construction, engineering and manufacturing problems, with the ability to create a federated model by merging multiple models to allow soft and hard clash detection analysis. CAD software helps us explore ideas, visualize concepts through photorealistic renderings and movies, and simulates how the BIM project will perform in the real world.</p>\n\n<p>New technologies are creating new occupations through enhancement, additions, and alterations. The role of Building Information Modeller is an emerging occupation with exciting implications for future career pathways.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":169,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Construction and Building Technology"},"event":{"id":594,"name":"WorldSkills Competition 2022 Special Edition","type":"competition","start_date":"2022-10-20","end_date":"2022-10-26","venue":"","town":"","code":"WSC2022SE","country":null,"utc_offset":null,"url":"","description":"","ws_entity":{"id":2541,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"WorldSkills Competition 2022 Special Edition"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/auth/ws_entities/2541","content_type":null,"description":null}]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594","content_type":null,"description":null},{"rel":"skills","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/skills","content_type":null,"description":null},{"rel":"sponsors","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/sponsors","content_type":null,"description":null},{"rel":"sectors","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/sectors","content_type":null,"description":null}]},"base_sector_id":2,"ws_entity":{"id":2542,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Construction and Building Technology"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/auth/ws_entities/2542","content_type":null,"description":null}]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/sectors/169","content_type":null,"description":null},{"rel":"groups","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/sectors/169/groups","content_type":null,"description":null},{"rel":"sponsors","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/sectors/169/sponsors","content_type":null,"description":null}]},"min_teams":0,"max_teams":null,"team_size":1,"identify_judges":false,"group_competitors":false,"compatriot_marking":false,"generate_500_scale":false,"landscape_marking":false,"competitor_max_age":26,"photos":[{"id":1208,"image_id":31285,"thumbnail_hash":"bb13c121-babd-4c26-a069-c3529f0b3274","thumbnail":"https://images.worldskillsusercontent.org/wsbb/ws13/31285/wsbb13c121-babd-4c26-a069-c3529f0b3274","description":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"sort":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/skills/1470/photos/1208","content_type":null,"description":null},{"rel":"image","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/images/31285","content_type":null,"description":null}]}],"tags":[],"sponsors":[],"ws_entity":{"id":2561,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Digital Construction"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/auth/ws_entities/2561","content_type":null,"description":null}]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/skills/1470","content_type":null,"description":null}]},{"id":1465,"event":{"id":594,"name":"WorldSkills Competition 2022 Special Edition","type":"competition","start_date":"2022-10-20","end_date":"2022-10-26","venue":"","town":"","code":"WSC2022SE","country":null,"utc_offset":null,"url":"","description":"","ws_entity":{"id":2541,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"WorldSkills Competition 2022 Special Edition"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/auth/ws_entities/2541","content_type":null,"description":null}]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594","content_type":null,"description":null},{"rel":"skills","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/skills","content_type":null,"description":null},{"rel":"sponsors","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/sponsors","content_type":null,"description":null},{"rel":"sectors","href":"https://api.worldskills.org/events/594/sectors","content_type":null,"description":null}]},"type":"official","base_id":145,"number":"18","status":"active","url_video":"","sort":0,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Electrical Installations"},"description":{"lang_code":"en","text":"<p>An electrician works on commercial, residential, agricultural, and industrial projects.

Much modern internal work is completed using drywall systems which involve the plasterer creating metal frames and installing plasterboard before the application on the final surface. These constructions can be complex and include curves and openings for doors and windows. Traditional plastering involves the preparation of the background prior to application of the plaster surface. The plasterer will prepare materials for use and be fully aware of legislation and official guidance relating to the preparation and use of materials. In addition to plastering flat surfaces, the skilled plasterer will create and install decorative mouldings. Plasterers will also be required to make repairs.</p>\n\n<p>The plasterer may work on large construction sites for domestic, commercial, or industrial use, in single domestic and commercial premises or on historic buildings and heritage sites. Much plastering work on larger sites is sub-contracted and as such many skilled plasterers will be self-employed, meaning that they have to take responsibility for tax and other earnings-related regulation.</p>\n\n<p>A high degree of accuracy, care, and skill is required. Preparation for plastering work will include complex mathematical calculations. The practitioner needs to be able to read, interpret, and analyse complex specifications describing the work required and be able to convert these plans into reality.</p>\n\n<p>A range of materials can be used depending on the site and the planned use of the finished building. Some materials can be harmful, so care must always be taken by the plasterer to prevent injury or damage in use or disposal of waste.</p>\n\n<p>Plasterers often form part of a team, working

There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the product required and the payment made by the customer. Therefore, the tiler has a continuing responsibility to work professionally in order to meet the requirements of the customer and thus maintain and grow the business. Tiling is closely associated with other parts of the construction industry, and with the many products that support it, normally for commercial purposes.</p>\n\n<p>The tiler works internally and externally, including in the homes of customers and on building sites, in all weather conditions, and on small and major projects. The work includes the laying of tiles of ceramics, mosaic, and natural stone on walls, floors, and staircases in houses, commercial, industrial, and public buildings, churches, swimming pools, outside installations and fa&ccedil;ades to provide protective, and decorative finishes. It also includes the construction of small walls and steps from bricks or blocks.</p>\n\n<p>The tiler will interpret drawings, set out and measure, remove any existing covering, prepare surfaces, lay the tiles in the desired pattern, grout, and finish to a high standard. Work organization and self-management, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, innovation and creativity, and working accurately are the universal attributes of the outstanding tiler. Whether the tiler is working alone (many are self-employed or sub-contractors) or in a team on large projects, the individual takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. Experienced tilers may also specialize in one area of work such as mosaics and they can work for specialist tiling firms specializing for example in artistic work or competition swimming pools.</p>\n\n<p>From working safely and tidily through to exceptional planning and scheduling, concentration, precision, accuracy, and attention to detail to achieve an excellent finish, every step in the process matters. Mistakes are largely irreversible and can be very costly</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;With the international mobility of people, the tiler faces rapidly expanding opportunities and challenges. For the talented tiler there are many commercial and international opportunities; however, these carry with them the need to understand and work with diverse cultures and trends. The diversity of skills associated with tilers is therefore likely to expand.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":169,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Construction

Digital Game Art"},"description":{"lang_code":"en","text":"<p>The games development sector comprises three occupations or work roles: the designer, the artist, and the programmer. The 3D Digital Game Artist takes a designer&rsquo;s brief and, through a combination of conceptualization, creativity, selectivity, technical, and specialist skills, completes the brief to the satisfaction of clients. The 3D Digital Game Artist receives, conceptualizes, and interprets design briefs on the basis of their market knowledge and skill sets, and the given scope and limits of the briefs. The skills required of the 3D Digital Game Artist can be broken down further into 2D concept art, texture painting, 3D modelling, rigging, and animating.</p>\n\n<p>After interpreting a brief, the 3D Digital Game Artist must produce a 2D digital concept of the required assets for the game, which could include objects, characters, and environments. This requires the development of good silhouettes enabling the designs can be recognized immediately without detail, with greyscale values that highlight the important details of an asset, in order to define a colour scheme based on the Artist&rsquo;s knowledge of colour balance, saturation, and mixing.</p>\n\n<p>The 3D Digital Game Artist must then produce a 3D mesh of the asset, making decisions for geometry, triangle count, symmetry, and silhouette, and modelling the edgeflow. UV unwrapping is used to flatten a 3D model into a 2D set of shells that a texture can be painted onto. This requires the ability to assign enough 3D mesh from the model for the model to render enough detail. The placement of the UV shells is a meticulous job. Artefacts must take into account the bleeding effect of colour on smaller versions of textures dependent on hardware, so these shells should be grouped by base colour.</p>\n\n<p>Textures are then produced to create materials that may be applied to the 3D model, taking into account the colours, secularity, and opacity of various parts of a model. Some textures are painted by hand; some require the use of photographic references and others require a digital process to calculate ambient occlusion and normal maps for shadows and detail. Next, the model may be rigged with bones in the 3D software in order to animate it either in the 3D software or the games engine.</p>\n\n<p>An artist may work in a team led by an Art Lead or Director, or in small companies with a programmer and designer. Artists may work in open areas for creative sharing, or in isolation on a strictly confidential basis.</p>\n\n<p>Despite tremendous growth in the sector, the 3D Digital Game Artist&rsquo;s role has evolved and split into specialisms, but otherwise remained constant, with an ongoing appreciation of aesthetics, colour, structure, and form as well as movement. The best artists are able to lead art teams solving visual errors and producing assets that operate on the fringes of the available technology to achieve the most absorbing experiences possible in a videogame.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":170,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Creative

The technical skills involved include design, pattern construction, cutting, and garment manufacture and finishing.</p>\n\n<p>The practitioner may work in one of several sectors but often they are self-employed and work on commissioned projects or in the retail manufacturing sector or in sampling garments for production. As such they need to have business acumen and strong interpersonal skills when dealing with clients. Excellent customer care and selling skills are important. As some work is often commissioned for important events, the practitioner must understand the needs of the client and be able to offer appropriate expert advice whilst interpreting the vision for the finished project. Customer briefs must be clearly understood and followed accurately.</p>\n\n<p>Fabrics are often expensive, delicate, and easily damaged if handled incorrectly. Given this, the practitioner must be respectful of the raw materials with which they work and apply extensive knowledge of effective sourcing, purchasing, handling, use, and storage of all materials. Sustainability, ethics and budgets are all serious considerations when sourcing materials and selecting sub-contractors.</p>\n\n<p>The design of a garment requires innovation, creativity, artistic talent, and design skills which incorporate aesthetics as well as function and other design practicalities. The practitioner must apply the rules and theory of composition including design elements and principles as well as excellent construction technique. They are often creative and artistic, with a good eye for design and the ability to create pleasing and functional garments, suitable for their purpose. In addition, a thorough knowledge and understanding of specialist equipment and its use is essential. Another requirement is a high level of technical knowledge in patternmaking and construction techniques. Different fabrics will have in various ways regarding design, as well as react in various ways to the manufacturing process and these characteristics must be considered throughout the design, preparation, and production process.</p>\n\n<p>There is a wide range of practice in the fashion sector. Some practitioners produce small ranges for retail outlets or high-class fashion houses or prepare bespoke garments ordered by individual clients. At the other end of the professional spectrum, the practitioner may work in an industrial setting, producing prototypes for mass production. Practice also varies across the world. The fashion industry is truly global: for example, a garment may be designed and prototyped in one country and sub-contracted for manufacture in another.</p>\n\n<p>Wherever employed, it is essential that the practitioner is aware of current and emerging fashions and trends in the fashion industry. Equally important is an awareness of new developments in fabrics and textiles as well as machinery and equipment. Significant damage can be done to a business and its reputation if fashion trends are misread.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":170,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Creative

skill of jewellery manufacturing consists of the making of fashion accessories using precious metal. A jewellery manufacturer can make exclusive individual pieces for use, pieces ready to be set with precious gemstones or prototypes for reproduction in numbers through lost-wax casting. A jeweller may also be required to replicate a piece directly, use jewellery making skills to refashion or repair an existing piece. A jewellery manufacturer will usually work from detailed drawings created through direct consultation with a client or by a jewellery designer. These designs can be developed by the jeweller through the use of hand sketching or the use of Computer-Aided Design (CAD). They will, therefore, need to be able to correctly interpret these drawings to create a jewellery piece as envisioned by themselves, a client, or a designer. Excellent communication skills and sufficiently in-depth knowledge in many areas of jewellery production and design are critical when understanding what the client or designer wants to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>A jeweller can do all the work on the product, but collaboration with other jewellers is possible. This allows for the sharing of manufacturing operations to better manage time and efficiency. It is essential that a jeweller understands production processes, even if they do not perform these themselves. An example of this would be outsourcing to a third party to complete a specific task or sharing a workspace with other jewellery makers or technicians with other specialist industry skills.</p>\n\n<p>Dealing with precious metals, a jeweller needs to be precise, work economically and avoid wastage of materials. The work is intricately detailed and requires a high level of skill, focus, and concentration. They must have a working knowledge of metal characteristics and how to prepare metal alloys should the need arise.</p>\n\n<p>Once the jeweller has finished a piece, it may progress to further phases of the manufacturing process requiring jewellery industry skills other than jewellery making e.g., gem-setting and casting. For this reason, a jeweller must have some knowledge and understanding of other jewellery industry skills. They must have an appreciation of gemstones, their characteristics, cuts, uses and impact on the finished piece. Similarly, they must be aware of the different phases of reproduction through casting and as mentioned above, a familiarity with CAD.</p>\n\n<p>Jewellers work with highly valuable materials, therefore must act with complete honesty and integrity. They must be fully aware of security and the regulations relating to the purchase, production and sale of precious metals, gemstones, and finished pieces. Whether working as part of a production team, or in the capacity of a sole manufacturer, a jeweller must have a thorough understanding of production costs, to enable them to arrive at an acceptable selling price, while maintaining profitability.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, there is now a consumer ethical awareness that drives decision making when commissioning or purchasing jewellery. A jeweller should be aware of and understand the social and ethical consequences when acquiring precious materials from around the world. They must, at all times endeavour to uphold these ethics in relation to sourcing precious metals and gemstones e.g. conflict diamonds, worker exploitation, environmental damage, etc.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":170,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Creative

The chief aim of a visual merchandiser is to maximize sales by communicating with the target audience and creating a positive atmosphere. The visual merchandiser communicates directly with the target audience through their designs and creates a positive impression which in turn impacts on the sales revenue of the business. Whilst not possible to precisely measure the impact of the visual merchandiser&rsquo;s displays it is accepted that they are an increasingly important element of the marketing and sales mix of a successful retail business.</p>\n\n<p>The visual merchandiser works in retail outlets, which are part of a group with central support functions and in small independent shops where there is greater personal autonomy and responsibility. The activities a visual merchandiser undertakes are based on interpreting and researching a brief, creating a design, and implementation &ndash; working with the products and their props.</p>\n\n<p>Work organization and self-management, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, innovation and creativity: the ability to develop original &lsquo;eye-catching&rsquo; concepts with the WOW factor which positively engage the target market and attention to detail/perfection are the universal attributes of the outstanding visual merchandiser.</p>\n\n<p>The visual merchandiser may work in teams or alone, depending on the size of the business. In medium to large businesses they work very closely with marketing and sales teams. Whatever the structure of the work, the trained and experienced visual merchandiser takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. From understanding the goals and targets of marketing and sales departments, interpreting the brief correctly and understanding the behaviour of target markets to creating a display with the WOW factor every stage in the visual merchandising process matters and displays have a close relationship with sales revenues.</p>\n\n<p>With the globalization of visual imagery and the international mobility of people, the visual merchandiser faces rapidly expanding opportunities and challenges. For the talented visual merchandiser there are many commercial and international opportunities; however, these carry with them the need to understand and work with diverse cultures, trends, and fashions. The diversity of skills associated with visual merchandising is therefore likely to expand.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":170,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Creative

multiple roles including, Systems Administrators/Engineers, Database Administrators, Network Administrators/Engineers, Storage Administrators/Engineers, Systems/Network/Solutions/Enterprise Architects, programmers/developers, and similar technology-driven roles which shoulder the business and functional responsibilities for architecting infrastructure design. Due to the ever-expanding features and capabilities of public cloud providers, this list of associated infrastructure specialists is also expanding.</p>\n\n<p>Infrastructure Architects are responsible for the overall design and direction for system and application deployments. These architects have traditionally created designs that have spanned multiple office locations as well as corporate and collocated data centres. With the growing prevalence of public cloud deployments, they have added IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) opportunities to their list of deployment tools. This allows these technology specialists to work towards migration solutions, offsite storage solutions, dynamic resource elasticity, and other design paradigms to create solutions that best fit the needs of each organization.</p>\n\n<p>Systems Administrators/Engineers are able to utilize public cloud providers in order to automate, expand, streamline, simplify, and accelerate their deployment models. Utilizing their experience in automation, these technologists can programmatically deploy infrastructure using the command line, language-specific SDK integrations, and infrastructure templating capabilities. This group is able to manage their technology footprint through the use of managed services to offload the administration of tasks such as managing a centralized activity logging by defining permissions and recording events. The ability to define a solution and then replicate that design to multiple environments and locations can be a significant responsibility of the position along with managing the integration of cloud computing offerings into existing technology solution sets.</p>\n\n<p>Database Administrators are increasingly engaging with public cloud providers as it gives them greater control over the details of their deployments. They are able to utilize resources on demand rather than waiting for resources from other departments. Additionally, they can use the advanced features of cloud providers such as managed database services for caching, relational databases, and NoSQL data solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Storage Administrators gain the flexibility to scale their storage needs without concern for hardware availability or capital expense. Using multiple storage offerings from cloud vendors, storage-related technology specialists can build solutions that best fit their storage needs using the tools provided by their vendor, or solutions from the vendor&rsquo;s 3rd party partners to deliver scalable, highly available primary and disaster recovery storage solutions. Implementing backups, deploying shared and clustered storage solutions, system snapshots, and data migrations are just a few examples of activities that can be automated via multiple programming languages using public cloud vendors and 3rd party partner solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Storage Administrators gain the flexibility to scale their storage needs without concern for hardware availability or capital expense.

Simultaneously, IT has become an official and unofficial political tool, as well as a means of new types of warfare. Many countries now deliver essential services online, to the extent that citizens without access to IT may become isolated and disadvantaged. This growing collective and individual dependency on IT places a significant obligation on IT service providers to safeguard their systems and users from intentional and unintentional breaches to the security of data and whole systems. As a result, the importance of the Cyber Security Professional cannot be overstated.</p>\n\n<p>A Cyber Security Professional works to protect an organization&rsquo;s computer systems networks, to ensure their robustness and prevent hackers from accessing and/or stealing sensitive information and data. The role typically involves configuring firewalls, IPS/IDS, server roles/services and web security solutions to protect confidential information.</p>\n\n<p>A Cyber Security Professional also monitors security breaches and investigates violations. They may conduct penetration testing by simulating attacks to search for vulnerabilities in their networks before they can be exploited for malicious reasons. Their forensic tasks include gathering, preserving, processing, analysing, and presenting computer-related evidence to mitigate networks&rsquo; vulnerability to criminal, fraud, and other hostile activities. They have a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures, using a full range of investigative tools and processes.</p>\n\n<p>A Cyber Security Professional usually also supports organizations&rsquo; disaster recovery plans, which describes the steps and procedures to restore proper function of an organization&rsquo;s IT systems and networks after a disaster or attack. These are of paramount importance, financially, reputationally, and for the continuation of essential services. Plans normally include preventative measures such as regular backing up of and transfer of data to an offsite location.</p>\n\n<p>In a fast-moving sector, Cyber Security Professionals must stay one step ahead of potential cyber-attackers. They must keep up with the latest methods attackers used to infiltrate computer systems, as well as with the new security technologies that can help organizations to counter these threats with robust systems and measures.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":171,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Information

Most people cannot imagine how important these technologies are in their lives. There is nothing that we use that hasn&rsquo;t in its manufacturing utilized CNC technology. It is present in products and objects of everyday life, such as cars, airplanes, components of machines of all types, moulds for tools used for household machines, medical prosthetics, cell phones, and toys.</p>\n\n<p>CNC milling machines are machine tools used for the shaping of metal and other solid materials. These machines exist in two basic forms: horizontal and vertical. This refers to the orientation of the cutting tool spindle. Early milling machines were manually or mechanically automated, but technological advances have led to the development of Computer Numerical Control, such as the CNC machining centre. CNC refers to a computer-controlled device to read and store instructions. This numerical information, generally &ldquo;G and M&rdquo; codes (a programming language) is then used to control and drive a machine tool which is a powered mechanical device (&ldquo;machining centre&rdquo;). A machining centre is used to fabricate components using cutting tools for removing the material.</p>\n\n<p>To form the finished part, the cutting process can be started from a solid block, pre-machined part, casting, or forgings. For those scenarios, the skill requires the highly skilled CNC milling machinist must read and interpret complex technical drawings and specifications, and work to a high degree of precision and detail. They must be proficient in metal work and understand how metals react to various processes. They must be a skilled computer operator and machine operator. The programs can be generated manually or using Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacture (CAD/CAM) software.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve the finished part, the CNC milling machinist undertakes a sequence of essential activities, from interpreting engineering drawings to optimizing the machining process:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Interpreting engineering drawings and following the specifications</li>\n\t<li>Generating the processes and programs with the CAD/CAM system and/or G and M-codes</li>\n\t<li>Setting up the tools, work holding devices, and work pieces on the CNC milling centre</li>\n\t<li>Manipulating cutting conditions, based on the properties of the material and tools</li>\n\t<li>Operating, inspecting, and maintaining the accuracy of dimensions within the specified tolerances</li>\n\t<li>Optimizing the process, taking into account the production type: whether large quantities of one part, small batches, or one-of-a-kind items.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Today a wide range of industries require CNC milling machinists to program, operate, and keep sophisticated machining centre&rsquo;s running in an efficient and reliable way. Large enterprises such as automobile plants, medium sized enterprises such as mould making, and small enterprises in the maintenance field, are some of many environments in which the CNC milling machinist plays a key, integral role to the success of the metalwork industries.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":172,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Manufacturing

Parts are made for household-equipment, telecommunications, cars, ships, aeroplanes, oil rigs, bridges, aerospace etc. Customers come from virtually every sector.</p>\n\n<p>In CNC Machining the movements of the machine through computers and servomotors are dictated by the programmer. Once correctly programmed and set up, these machines can produce almost any shape and can repeat the process many times. This offers great advantages for quality and efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>CNC Machining covers a broad variety of machining processes, such as grinding, welding, electrical discharging, milling and also turning.</p>\n\n<p>Some may think that lathes (turning machines) are built to make round parts; however, CNC lathes are capable of producing almost any shape and any part.</p>\n\n<p>Every customer has different requirements and demands and therefore each part is made of different materials, and needs different geometries, dimensions and surface qualities. To explain all the desired requirements to the machinist, the customer produces a technical drawing.</p>\n\n<p>Machining starts with deciding how best to produce the part. There are many ways of doing this, like welding, milling, casting, and 3D Printing. One very important method is CNC Turning.</p>\n\n<p>A CNC lathe is a very accurate computer-driven machine, where cutting tools, controlled by a program, are moved to cut away excessive material to result in the expected customer part. The CNC Turning machinist receives the technical drawing and uses the lathe in many ways to find solutions to build the part. These machines are very expensive, because they can do remarkable things. To have an idea of this, think what it means to achieve accuracy below ten microns, which is six to10 times thinner than a human hair.</p>\n\n<p>The CNC Turning machinist uses a computer to tell the lathe how to move the tools and cut the part to the desired shape. They must also set up the lathe with all the necessary clamping devices, support devices, and cutting tools. These tools can cut almost every material (stainless steel, plastic, soft steel, aluminium, bronze, and so on). But the machinist has to choose well to avoid temperature variations, tool wear or vibration. Those factors influence the product and it can result in poor quality.</p>\n\n<p>When the machine starts cutting material, the machinist makes sure that the dimensions exactly fit the customer specifications. For this, very accurate inspection tools are used. Once the machine is set up, the CNC-Turning machinist also monitors and optimizes the processes, to achieve even faster and better results for all the following parts.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":172,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Manufacturing

This is a specialised occupation in its own right, and also involves the creation of production documents such as Bills of Material, Gerber Files and Excellon drill files, and other automated equipment files.</p>\n\n<p>Electronics specialists work in a wide range of industries supported by highly technical specialist equipment. Almost every aspect of today&rsquo;s world relies on, or directly uses, electronics technology. It can be said that all technologies today use Electronics in one form or another.</p>\n\n<p>Electronics Engineering Technician/Technologists must work with a high degree of accuracy and precision, conforming to detailed specifications and international quality standards and demonstrating extensive technical ability. Due to the constant developments in technology, the electronics Engineering Technician/Technologist needs to be proactive in ensuring that his/her skills and knowledge are up-to-date and meet industry standards and expectations.</p>\n\n<p>The Engineering Technician/Technologist may work directly with clients and will therefore need to demonstrate excellent customer service and communication skills and work effectively to time schedules. When working with clients, the Engineering Technician/Technologist may have to explain elements of complex electronics principles to assist the client to use equipment correctly. Often the nature of the establishment in which the electronics Engineering Technician/Technologist works will require them to respect confidentiality in relation to highly commercially sensitive information and to demonstrate integrity, honesty, and a strong ethical sense.</p>\n\n<p>The electronics specialist will work with a wide range of tools. These tools are often specialized and include measurement test equipment. Computers and specialist software development tools are used to create programs for embedded systems, programmable devices, and desktop systems. In addition, tasks will also require the use of specialist hand tools for the assembly and maintenance and rework of circuits. Surface mounted technology (SMT) is the dominant technology.</p>\n\n<p>Industry also relies on Engineering Technician/Technologists to implement software solutions used to address manufacturing requirements. Engineering Technician/Technologists may also setup, configure and tune automated assemblies, circuits, systems, and processes.</p>\n\n<p>Embedding microcontroller units (MCUs) into systems forms the basis for Embedded Systems Engineering and is another electronics specialism. Embedded System design involves interfacing MCUs to the outside world via sensors/communication interfaces. It also involves the writing of quality software to perform required tasks.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":172,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Manufacturing

Mobile robotics is an important part of the future, with applications in everyday life, diverse industries, including autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, agriculture, aerospace, mining, and medicine.</p>\n\n<p>A robotics technologist works in offices, manufacturing plants or laboratories; he or she designs, maintains, develops new applications and conducts research to expand the potential for robots. The role begins with a strong focus on a specific business problem, in a particular sector. For example, in manufacturing there may be a need to increase capacity by creating robots for tasks that can be automated. Mobile robots may also be designed to explore areas that are inaccessible or dangerous for human beings.</p>\n\n<p>Careful, deep client consultation is required, resulting in an accurate specification. The design phase follows and a prototype is assembled. The robot is then programmed and tested to ensure high, consistent performance. At the heart of every robot is a robotics technologist who thinks about what a robot needs to do and works with several disciplines to design and put together the optimal piece of equipment, demonstrating a commitment to attention to detail. In this instance the robotics technologist uses existing technologies to create solutions to new challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Robotics technologists must be familiar with logic, microprocessors, computer programming, mechanical, electrical, and control system so that they can design and prototype the right robot for each application. They must also prepare specifications for the robot&#39;s capabilities as they relate to the everyday life. In addition, robotics technologists are responsible for cost efficient design, cost-price calculations and quality-control.</p>\n\n<p>Integral to the role of the high performing robotics technologist are a range of skills related to work organization and self-management. Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with a particular strength in working well in a team, are equally important. An ability to be innovative and creative in resolving technological challenges and generating solutions is also essential.</p>\n\n<p>Working across sectors internationally and being able to transfer analytical skills is a feature of the excellent robotics technologist, together with a commitment to continuing specialist, and professional development and a determination to resolve problems through experimenting and risk taking within self-managed boundaries. In an increasingly global industry, which is &lsquo;breaking new ground&rsquo; and altering the way we live and work, there are significant opportunities for sustainable careers in robotics. The opportunities carry with them the need to work with diverse cultures, industries and fast paced technological change. The diversity of skills associated with robotics technologists is likely to expand.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":172,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Manufacturing

Modelling"},"description":{"lang_code":"en","text":"<p>The prototype modelling practitioner is involved with the design, creation, testing, and modification of prototypes. In many fields, there is great uncertainty as to whether a new design will actually do what is desired. New designs often have unexpected problems. A prototype is often used as part of the product design process to give engineers and designers the ability to explore design alternatives, test theories, and confirm performance prior to starting production of a new product. Prototype modelling</p>\n\n<p>practitioners use their experience to tailor prototypes according to the specific unknowns still present in the intended designs. For example, some prototypes are used to confirm and verify consumer interest in a proposed design, whereas other prototypes will attempt to verify the performance or suitability of a specific design approach.</p>\n\n<p>In general, an iterative series of prototypes will be designed, constructed, and tested as the final design emerges and is prepared for production. In most cases, multiple iterations of prototypes are used progressively to refine the design. It is common to design, test, evaluate, and then modify the design based on analysis of the prototype.</p>\n\n<p>In many product development organizations, prototyping specialists are employed. These are individuals with specialized training and skills in general fabrication techniques that can help bridge theoretical designs and fabrication of prototypes. For a company engaged in rapid prototyping and manufacturing or functional testing, prototype models are crucial for troubleshooting potential problems in the design process.</p>\n\n<p>A team with excellent interpersonal and communication skills will provide clients with confidence that the specialist advice and guidance resulting from prototyping fully supports their production plans. The prototyping engineering technician will require a range of skills including 3D CAD systems, CAM systems such as milling, printing, and other CAM machining, vacuum casting, prototype model making by hand tools and machines, and spray painting and finishing.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":172,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Manufacturing

is a critical process that is controlled by both national and international standards and specifications to regulate the quality of the deposited weld metal and the skill of the welder.</p>\n\n<p>A welder prepares and joins a range of metals and metallic alloys using mainly processes where an electric arc is the heat source. Electric arc processes utilize a gas shield or a flux to protect the molten weld area from contamination by the surrounding atmosphere. A welder needs to be able to interpret engineering drawings, standards and symbols and correctly translate these requirements into accurate structures and fabrications.</p>\n\n<p>Welders need to have a thorough knowledge and understanding of safe working practices, personal protection equipment and the hazards and practices associated with the welding and fabrication industries. They need to gain specific knowledge of a wide range of welding equipment and processes as well as an understanding of how welding will affect the structure of the material being welded. They need to be familiar with electricity and how it is utilized for welding.</p>\n\n<p>A welder prepares, assembles and joins a wide range of metals and metal alloys using various welding processes including manual metal arc welding, shielded metal arc welding, metal arc gas shielded welding, gas metal arc welding, tungsten arc gas shielded welding, gas tungsten arc welding, and flux cored arc welding. A welder will use mainly processes where the heat utilized for welding will be an electric arc to join a range of materials including the commonly joined and fabricated materials &ndash; carbon steel, stainless steels, aluminium and copper and their associated alloys. They must be able to select the correct equipment, process variables, and welding technique, depending upon the material being joined.</p>\n\n<p>Welders may use thermal cutting processes and should be able to identify the correct preparation for joining as applied to the type, thickness and intended use of the joint. They use grinding and cutting equipment to prepare welded joints. Modern methods of joining, as well as those noted above, include mechanized processes such as submerged arc, plasma arc, stud welding, and laser welding.</p>\n\n<p>Welders join sections, pipe and plate and fabricate large and small pressure vessels. A welder can work in a unit or factory which produces fabrications and/or structures for industries as diverse as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, transport, marine engineering, construction, service, and leisure industries. Welders also work on site preparation, construction, and the repair and maintenance of structures. A welder can work in many locations and situations, ranging from a bench in a factory, to shipyards, power stations and off-shore structures. Welders also work in engineering, construction, power generating, and petro-chemical plants. The working environment may include hazards such as being off shore, with extreme weather conditions and also in confined spaces where access to the joint to be welded is restricted.</p>\n\n<p>The modern welder may specialize in one or a number of welding processes and environments. They may also be asked to work on exotic alloys such as duplex and super duplex stainless steels and cupronickels. Welders are required to carry out the finest work where faults and failure may have the most serious consequences in terms of cost, safety and environmental damage.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":172,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Manufacturing

professional chef can work in a wide range of establishments including high-class and casual restaurants, hotels, welfare caterings such as hospitals and residential homes, theme parks, airlines, ships, clubs, retail HMR and Food To-Go, Fast Food outlets, and industrial canteens; providing catering services to both guests and staff. The range of skills and customer expectations will vary according to the workplace. There is also a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service provided and the payment made by the customer.</p>\n\n<p>The professional chef can also deliver different styles of dining such as fine dining, banqueting, casual dining, cocktail dining, canteen and take-away dining, as well as different styles of food service including plated, a la carte, and set menu service, buffet self-service, silver service, canteen counter service, and breakfast service. As well as the skill of cooking, the role of a chef will also demand further skills that relate to cooking in a commercial setting and therefore working towards a budget or expected profit margin. These skills include menu compilation, food costing, purchasing, storage, utilization of food commodities and minimizing wastage, as well as the control, work/time organization, planning, and communication required in managing a kitchen brigade.</p>\n\n<p>Professional chefs need to demonstrate outstanding skills in food preparation (with both speed and accuracy), in production (using varied cooking methods and techniques) and in the final presentation and flavour. They are expected to create and adapt dishes that meet the expectations of demanding customers with varying nutritional and religious dietary requirements. Fashions and trends in cuisine also fluctuate, so it is important that the professional chef keeps abreast of these trends and adapts their product and service accordingly The Professional chef needs to be adept at managing food cost and maintaining environmentally-friendly sustainable food production by making use of locally sourced and seasonal ingredients, as well as controlling unnecessary waste by creatively re-using trimmings and reducing ingredient wastage.</p>\n\n<p>Strict maintenance of the highest level of personal and food hygiene and safety are paramount at all times. Failure to fulfil this requirement can have a devastating impact on a diner&rsquo;s health and well-being, and may cause irreparable damage to the restaurant&rsquo;s reputation and business.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial kitchens are equipped with complex specialist equipment that must be used carefully to avoid accident and injury. Kitchens are potentially dangerous places to work. Staff work under intense pressure, often in a confined space, working with hot food and dangerous tools and equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Effective communication skills are essential for the chef. A professional kitchen is a high-pressure environment where teams of chefs specializing in various aspects of the menu work together to produce the entire meal. Co-ordination of the kitchen brigade is essential to quality assure the dishes being sent to the restaurant and to meet very tight service time frames. In addition, the kitchen team need to work effectively with other departments in the hotel or restaurant to ensure a good overall experience for the guest. - A customer is expecting a memorable meal experience which incorporates the setting and ambiance of the restaurant, staff interaction, and outstanding customer care, as well as exceptional food.</p>\n\n<p>With the globalization of cuisine, chefs can work all over the world. Talented chefs are always in demand and have opportunities to travel and work in some of the most interesting and exciting international destinations. This carries with it the need to appreciate diverse cultures, especially with regard to using locally available ingredients, and observing local dietary requirements and traditions.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":173,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Social

Travel and tourism therefore plays an important role in social and economic growth throughout the world.</p>\n\n<p>Hotels of many types, sizes and ownership are an essential part in this industry, providing accommodation and associated services to guests from across the globe. They may be part of international hotel chains which market their services on consistency and familiarity for the frequent or regular guest. Alternatively, they may promote distinct characteristics based on their locality, history, architecture, and targeted clientele. Quality and price generally go together; for reserving accommodation, an international rating system of stars can provide a reasonable indication of what might be expected within the range of prices associated with a locality.</p>\n\n<p>The role of Hotel Receptionist is key to every hotel establishment. At the hotel&rsquo;s reception area guests receive their first impression of the hotel and therefore of their probable hotel experience. This is where the primary communication with the hotel staff is established. The quality, courtesy and promptness of service can make a great difference, positively or negatively, to the guest&rsquo;s relationship with the hotel and their satisfaction during their stay. This in turn affects the hotel&rsquo;s reputation and repeat business.</p>\n\n<p>The Hotel Receptionist works mainly in the hotel&rsquo;s front office. Hotel receptionists need to use a wide range of skills continuously. These may include knowledge of local and general tourism information, good verbal and written English, computer literacy, good manners and conduct and grooming, excellent communication and social skills, problem solving, competence with figures and cash handling, and the application of procedures for reservations, reception, guest services and check out.</p>\n\n<p>If the Hotel Receptionist possesses these skills and uses them well, the scope for promotion and mobility is great.

A food service practitioner generally works in the commercial sector, offering a range of services to customers. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service required and the payment made by the guest. Therefore, the practitioner has a continuing responsibility to work professionally and interactively with the guest in order to give satisfaction and thus maintain and grow the business.</p>\n\n<p>The practitioner is likely to work in a hotel or restaurant. However, the size, nature and quality of these establishments can vary enormously from internationally renowned hotel chains to smaller, privately-owned, more intimate restaurants. The quality and level of service provided and expected by guests will also vary. The styles of service will be dependent on the targeted customer and can range from simple self-service operations to elaborate service styles where dishes can be prepared at the guests&rsquo; table. In its more elaborate form, food, and drink service can be likened to a form of theatre.</p>\n\n<p>High quality food and drink service requires the practitioner to have extensive knowledge of international cuisine, beverages, and wines. They must have a complete command of accepted serving rules and must know the preparation of speciality dishes and drinks at the guests&rsquo; table or in the bar. The food server is the most important person in attending to the guests and providing the meal experience. Skill and resourcefulness, good manners, excellent interaction with guests, aplomb, excellent personal and food hygiene practices, smart appearance, and practical ability are all essential.</p>\n\n<p>A wide range of specialist tools and materials will be used for the service of specialist dishes, drinks, and wines. The practitioner will be familiar with their use in addition to the more usual pieces of equipment that are found in most dining situations.</p>\n\n<p>Irrespective of the working environment, excellent communication, and customer care skills are universal attributes of the outstanding practitioner. Food service personnel will work as part of a team and with other teams in the hotel or restaurant. Whatever the structure of the work, the trained and experienced practitioner takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. This ranges from safeguarding the health and wellbeing of the guests and colleagues through scrupulous attention to safe and hygienic working practices, to achieving exceptional experiences for special occasions.</p>\n\n<p>With the globalization of gastronomy, the expansion of travel for pleasure and business, and the international mobility of people, staff in the hospitality industry enjoy rapidly expanding opportunities and challenges. For the talented restaurateur there are many commercial and international opportunities; however, these carry with them the need to understand and work with diverse cultures, trends, and environments. The diversity of skills associated with restaurant service is therefore likely to keep expanding.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":173,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Social

Repair"},"description":{"lang_code":"en","text":"<p>Autobody repairers realign both the structure and the panelling of both light and heavy-duty vehicles after they have been involved in collisions. This can often be a complex process as each collision will present different degrees and directions of damage. The repaired vehicle must conform to the stringent specifications established by the vehicle manufacturer and meet both their tolerances and their safety specifications. An autobody repairer needs to be familiar with MET (mechanical/electrical/trim) components and their function as well as the specific and often complex safety restraint systems (SRS) fitted to modern vehicles. The autobody repairer returns the vehicle to a condition where it is ready for refinishing.</p>\n\n<p>An autobody repairer works in a facility dedicated to repair and is equipped with the machinery and equipment suitable to repair a wide variety of modern passenger cars. An autobody repairer&rsquo;s work is often divided between major and minor collision damage; however, skills in both areas may often be used on the same vehicle. In a major collision repair the autobody repairer will mount the vehicle onto a specialized body jig with which he or she can diagnose the direction and extent of the misalignment to the car body structure. He or she then attaches heavy hydraulic pulling equipment to the body and uses this pulling force to reverse the damaging force.</p>\n\n<p>After the misalignment has been rectified to the structure the repairer will normally have to remove damaged structural and non-structural members which are replaced with new sections or part sections using various welding processes and/or riveting and bonding. For a minor collision an autobody repairer may replace or repair non-structural panels to a condition suitable for refinishing. Repairers must be able to use vehicle body alignment benches and associated measuring equipment (universal and fixed bracket) as a means of assessing the extent of damage and reinstating the structure to its original specifications. An autobody repairer must be a skilled welder who is capable of joining a variety of metals such as low carbon steel, high strength steels or aluminium alloys using metal active gas welding (MAG), and resistance/inverter spot welding.</p>\n\n<p>He or she must be able to select the correct consumables for the metal being welded and adjust the machine to provide an efficient high quality weld. In some circumstances body panels may be replaced using bonding and riveting equipment.

The scope of the role will be determined by the size of the organization; generally, the larger the organization the more specialized the role will be.

However broad or narrow the role, its core is the preparation of quotations, the processing of orders and the calculation of costs and price. The Freight Forwarder deals with written and telephone correspondence, sometimes using two or more languages, normally including English. They also prepare delivery notes and deal with complaints. In smaller, less compartmentalized organizations the Freight Forwarder may also need to coordinate transport and warehousing. Increasingly this role operates in a paperless environment.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Freight Forwarder is individually responsible for the quality of their own work, since the movement of freight is a 24-hour operation, they have a mutual dependency on both other Freight Forwarders and also the broader quality of the organization&rsquo;s procedures and systems. The Freight Forwarder is the customer-facing part of the organization, whose transactions lead to contracts which must be robust, cost-effective and encourage repeat business. The quality of the Freight Forwarder&rsquo;s communication with the customer from initial enquiry through to safe delivery is vital. This is especially the case with customer complaints, which require a close knowledge of each stage of the agreed service and efficient problem solving within the given procedures.</p>\n\n<p>The Freight Forwarder is dependent on each stage of the freight moving process working as intended. Therefore, their work will be affected by many human and non-human factors. Locally and nationally there are seasonal factors, including weather and major festivals and holidays, and also infrastructural factors. For international freight, the factors multiply, one of the greater complexities being customs. Depending on the place of the organization within the market for logistics and supply, some freight may require exceptional care, or urgency, or priority treatment. So, although the Freight Forwarder works within tight procedures, they must also be highly responsive to the large and small issues that impact on their role daily or occasionally.</p>\n\n<p>Freight forwarding and supply is a growing sector; this is a long-term trend associated with globalization. Therefore, it is a very attractive area for employment. At the same time, the sector is very vulnerable to the disruptive impact of technology on a large and rapid scale as networks are integrated and robotics advance. A Freight Forwarder who has the capacity to be both exact and responsive as required will be in a strong position to take advantage of this volatility and growth for the benefit of both commerce and society.</p>\n"},"description_required_skills":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_industry_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_competition_action":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"description_facts":{"lang_code":"en","text":""},"group":null,"sector":{"id":174,"name":{"lang_code":"en","text":"Transportation
